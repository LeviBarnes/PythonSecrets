# PythonSecrets
Python tutorial for young code-breakers

This is a tutorial designed for absolute beginning programmers who have some interest in codes and 
code-breaking. It teaches some basic programming concepts (lists, loops, branching) in the context
of writing a Python program to encode and decode messages using a passphrase. 

This is an jupyter notebook. To use it, you'll need to have jupyter which allows you to 
easily share powerful tutorials and presentations in a browser window. Notebook is found here: 
http://jupyter.org 

The easiest way to install these is using pip. (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/)

Once you've installed jupyter, you should be able to invoke

%> jupyter-notebook SecretCodes.ipynb

A new browser window should open in which you can explore the notebook. You're be encouraged to write
and execute your code right in the browser. You can also make changes to the notebook in case you have
ideas on how to improve this tutorial.

You can also ask mybinder to host it for you to avoid the install step. https://mybinder.org
